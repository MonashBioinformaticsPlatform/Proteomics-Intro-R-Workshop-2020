# Workshop Objective(s)

Aka - what we hope you get out the workshops:

* Introduction to R
* R basics: different classes
* How to plot in R
* How to find more information for a specific task in R
* Entry into more advanced & specialised uses for R in your research

```{r, echo=FALSE, success_image, out.width="35%", out.height="35%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/success.png")
```

## R

Programming language for statistical computing and graphics

Lots of plotting functionality and well geared towards data analysis out of box with in-built statistical tests

An analysis toolbox & [well developed ecosystem](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/) of software packages that further expands base R for analysis, project management, visualisation, document generation, collaboration, etc


```{r, echo=FALSE, toolbox_image, out.width="50%", out.height="40%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/toolbox.png")
```

# Why Else Should You Use It?

* Continous active development & thorough documentation

* Low risk of inadvertent data loss/mutation
  * By design, R requires you to load your data in, what you do with the data is then written in code (R language). 

* Reproducible analysis
  * Document what you have done with your data in code. 
  * Come back to it in days, months, years and you should know what was done.

* Easy to collaborate and share your analysis

```{r, echo = FALSE}
anicon::nia("FREE!", animate = "pulse", color = "#0086b3", size = 2)
```

  ### Challenge: Are you ready for the workshop?
  
  1. Do you have a link to the workshop material?
  2. Are you logged in to R-Studio Cloud?
  3. Do you have a link to the Etherpad?
  
  
  Raise the appropriate sticky note for your situation.

## Wrapping Up

* R is a programming language and your code can be recorded in an R script file. 

* Data we are using may not feel relevant to you, but will help you master the basic concepts behind R. 

* R is particular with typo errors, if it doesn’t work, check you have typed things in correctly. 

* Don't be afraid to ask for help! Either put up a sticky note or ask out loud, we can't emphasis this point enough!

* You can come back to the course material any time. The Monash Bioinformatics Platform has more R workshop course materials, check out our github or the Monash Data Fluency github

* If you're around Clayton, we run a help session every Friday at 3pm. Come and say hi!
