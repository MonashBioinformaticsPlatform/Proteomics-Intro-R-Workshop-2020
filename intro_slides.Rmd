# Workshop Objective(s)

Aka - what we hope you get out the workshops:

* Introduction to R
* R basics: different classes
* How to plot in R
* How to find more information for a specific task in R
* Entry into more advanced & specialised uses for R in your research

---

# What is R & Why Should You Use It?

Programming language for statistical computing and graphics

* Has lots of plotting functionality and well geared towards data analysis out of box with in-built statistical tests

* [Well developed ecosystem](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/) of software packages that further expands base R for analysis, project management, visualisation, document generation, collaboration, etc

* Continous active development & thorough documentation

* Reproducible analysis

* Low risk of inadvertent data loss/mutation

* Collaborative
