# Why use R

Programming language for statistical computing and graphics

Has lots of plotting functionality and well geared towards data analysis out of box with in-built statistical tests

[Well developed ecosystem](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/) of software packages that further expands base R for analysis, project management, visualisation, document generation, collaboration, etc

Continous active development & thorough documentation

```{r, fig.align="center", echo = FALSE,  out.height="90%",  eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/free.png")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
anicon::nia("FREE!", animate = "pulse", color = "#0086b3")
```
